# ManimBooks

Students often use dynamic media like YouTube videos to understand math or science concepts since the visualizations in textbooks are not enough. However, watching lengthy videos takes time. Videos cannot be quickly referred unlike textbooks, and they cannot replace the traditional method of teaching using books. Ordinary teachers cannot make such engaging content which is available on YouTube and are often helpless when it comes to providing high-quality animated illustrations to students. Hence, we provide a hybrid solution where the scientific or mathematical concepts can be animated inside the book itself using high-quality illustrations. ManimBooks is an E-book format which has all the basic features of any book (like PDFs) but with the added benefit of including animations. They can be referred quickly offline or online, and the text is readily available for citation unlike videos.
